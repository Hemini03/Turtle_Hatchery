    <section class="content">
      Kosgoda, a town on Sri Lanka's southwest coast, is well-known for its
      turtle hatcheries and conservation initiatives. The Kosgoda Sea Turtle
      Conservation Project is a well-known turtle hatchery in Kosgoda. Through a
      variety of initiatives, the Kosgoda Turtle Hatchery seeks to preserve and
      protect sea turtles. They actively participate in the removal of turtle
      eggs from shoreline nesting areas that are under risk. The eggs are then
      transferred to the hatchery, where they are incubated to maximize their
      chances of survival in a secure and controlled environment. The Green
      turtle, Hawksbill turtle, Loggerhead turtle, and Olive Ridley turtle are
      among the sea turtle species that can be learned about by visitors to the
      Kosgoda Turtle Hatchery. The hatchery offers instructive tours during
      which knowledgeable staff members provide details about the life of the
      animals.
