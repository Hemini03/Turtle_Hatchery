      <h2>About Hikkaduwa Turtle Hatchery</h2>
      <p>
        The turtle hatchery is located in the sea, roughly 2km from Hikkaduwa.
        The center manages and protects some of the endangered species of
        turtles. Hikkaduwa turtle hatchery is one of the main turtle hatcheries
        on the southern coast of the land.
        <br>
      <p>Hikkaduwa, a coastal town in Sri Lanka's southwest, is renowned for its stunning beaches and abundant marine life. The Turtle Hatchery, where attempts are undertaken to protect marine turtles, is one well-liked site in Hikkaduwa.

        You may find out more about the various sea turtle species that can be found in Sri Lanka, such as the Green turtle, Hawksbill turtle, Loggerhead turtle, and Olive Ridley turtle, at the Turtle Hatchery. By obtaining their eggs from threatened nesting locations and keeping them secure until they hatch, the hatchery hopes to safeguard these endangered turtles.
        
        Visitors can watch young turtles in aquariums, learn about their life cycle, and even take part in the releasing of hatchlings into the ocean at the hatchery. Additionally, the hatchery offers details on the dangers that the eggs confront.</p>
